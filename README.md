## Description

Recipes is an app that lets you find recipes, how to cook them, add to wishlist. I used `Nestjs` framework, `Sequelize` ORM, `PostgreSQL` database, `Tasty` third-party API, `GraphQL` to communicate, `Next.js` (v14) framework and corresponding features, `Zustand` state manager, cache manager, google auth, `nestjs-i18n` internationalization, prettier etc.
